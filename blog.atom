that front-end developers are facing in 2012 and beyond. I gained more than I ever thought possible.

      &lt;p&gt;The following post is a long-winded summary of my experiences over the past year. I started a user group, wrote a book,
gave up a secure job, and changed jobs 4 times. All to push myself, get uncomfortable, and better understand the challenges
that front-end developers are facing in 2012 and beyond. I gained more than I ever thought possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you have to give up everything to find something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost one year ago (September 2011), I started the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/AtlantaHTML5/&quot;&gt;HTML5 user group&lt;/a&gt; in Atlanta Georgia.
This started as an experiment and outlet for me to practice my front-end related presentations. I really had no idea who
would come or how fast the group would grow. But much to my surprise, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/AtlantaHTML5/events/29823121/&quot;&gt;first meetup&lt;/a&gt;
brought out around 60 attendees. &lt;a href=&quot;http://wesleyhales.com/blog/2012/07/19/HTML5-in-Atlanta/&quot;&gt;One year later&lt;/a&gt;, the group has over 1200 members,
5 awesome sponsors, and I am now connected to some of the coolest people, developers and thought leaders in the industry.
I could write an entire blog post on this topic alone, but starting this group has been one of the most humbling experiences of my life.
Many of the folks that come out to the meetups remind me of different stages that I’ve gone through in my career.
Some are far ahead of me and are doing things that I really admire and others are just starting out and looking for work.
Overall, I’ve learned that community creates technology. HTML5 and mobile have inspired developers and designers to think
differently and do new amazing things, but in the end, it’s the developers and community who collectively see through the
marketing hype of products and platforms to choose viable/useful solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The month after starting Atlanta HTML5 (October 2011), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.html5rocks.com/en/mobile/optimization-and-performance/&quot;&gt;an article that I’d been working on for months&lt;/a&gt;
was finally published on html5rocks.com. It just so happened that the article went out the day before my presentation at JavaOne 2011.
So everything aligned really nicely and the talk went well. This all leads up to me authoring a book.
During my stay in SF, I was introduced to Meghan Blanchette who is an editor at O’Reilly. We started talking and I told
her it would be cool to write a book. I casually agreed that I’d send her a proposal for a book that talks about
HTML5 in the enterprise. After all, I come from a decade of heavy middleware stacks and server-side generated markup.
So I thought my perspective might be valuable as developers make the transition to offline capable clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2011, my proposal was accepted and I signed the O’Reilly contract for a book entitled “HTML5 Architecture”
, which would later be renamed to &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024088.do&quot;&gt;“HTML5 and JavaScript Web Apps”&lt;/a&gt;.
This was a huge personal step for me. At first it was very exciting and I was motivated to create the best HTML5 related
book the world had ever seen. I committed to the fact that I would give up countless afternoons and weekends
(away from my wife and kids) to research and write about the latest web technologies available to developers.
I had this burning desire to understand how HTML5 would affect us both now and in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now, lets get back to reality and my day job. While I had grandiose visions of creating a kick ass book, I still had
obligations and commitments to maintain for my employer, Red Hat. During this time I was involved with a new project,
actually this was the second project I co-founded at JBoss -  we named it &lt;a href=&quot;http://aerogear.org/&quot;&gt;AeroGear&lt;/a&gt; and officially
launched in February of 2012. AeroGear now employs some of the greatest developers of our time. It is truly an honor to
say I was a part of this project and I will always admire and respect what the developers behind this project produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not long after AeroGear was launched, and after I’d spent a few months researching and writing my book, I realised that
I was out of touch with what developers were truly facing. It’s easy to write about what “you think” developers want and
need. But it’s a completely different story when you’re in the trenches and in the real-world of day to day development
activities. So, I gave up my 4+ year tenure at Red Hat and submitted my resignation. Trust me, this was not an easy thing
to do. I had a really awesome job at Red Hat, I worked remote and the company fully supported me to evangelize whatever
project I was working on. This means I got to work and travel all over the world, and work with the brightest developers
in our industry. But, I wanted more on a personal level. Not just for my book, but because I had gotten way too comfortable
with my day job. From what I’ve seen, as IT professionals, it hurts us to stay at a job longer than 4 or 5 years these days.
imo unless you have some really nice golden handcuffs or are truly happy with your situation, depending on a company for retirement
is suicide. So I took it upon myself to become uncomfortable and to get back out in the real world. The only way you can
experience the problems and challenges developers face is to be one of them and work in their environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March of 2012, I put in my 2 week notice at Red Hat and decided to become an independent consultant. I had interviewed
at quite a few companies and decided the best route to take was the most uncomfortable one - a pair programming Ruby/UI developer.
So I started a contract with a Cox owned property and experienced, first hand, the problems that professional developers face.
Things like converting a six year old legacy B2B application from prototype.js to jQuery. Other front-end problems like
jQuery architecture and writing plugins, strategies to bubble up DOM events, etc... CSS formatting, preprocessor strategies
and many more issues that your average corporate developers desire to get right. I was finally in the trenches with an audience
that “I thought” I previously understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the weeks/months before my consulting time at Cox/Manheim I had been engaged by Square, Google and Wikipedia for potential jobs offers.
So I was rushing home in the afternoons to interview for positions that would move me out to the bay area. Unfortunately these
opportunities didn’t work out for whatever reason, but honestly, putting myself out there and going through these grueling
interview processes helped me out tremendously - as you will see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.wesleyhales.com/images/posts/2012-11-01/543116336.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;devnexus&quot; class=&quot;margin10&quot; style=&quot;max-width:50%&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;
On a side note and speaking of &quot;putting myself out there&quot;, on March 21st I had agreed to do a talk at a local conference
here in Atlanta called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devnexus.com/&quot;&gt;DevNexus&lt;/a&gt;. As I was creating the slides for my presentation, I kept thinking
about how I would verbally survey the audience at certain points to get a feel for what their experience level was.
“Raise your hand if...” kind of thing...Then I thought, hey! I can just write a simple HTML+CSS slide deck and create a
WebSocket back end that will allow the audience to participate with their mobile phone. Cool! So I spent a week hacking
on this and finally got a prototype up and running.
I did the talk and the room was packed, people were &lt;a href=&quot;http://wesleyhales.com/images/posts/2012-11-01/c70jx.jpg&quot;&gt;spilling out into the hallways&lt;/a&gt; (ok, so it wasn’t exactly a HUGE room,
but still it’s fun to say) Anyway, The talk went great and I had almost 100% audience participation. I was invited back
the next day to give the same talk after another speaker backed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I was an independent contractor, I had this feeling of, yes, you guessed it... independence. I was getting paid Corp-2-Corp
through whoever would hire me at a specified hourly rate. I was able to speak at conferences on organic, community topics and
I wasn’t giving a sales pitch for a specific product or platform. I was a hired gun and making it on my own, paying high insurance
costs for my family (and business), and making one hell of a commute.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/highgroove/6958058518/sizes/o/in/photostream/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.wesleyhales.com/images/posts/2012-11-01/onslyde.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;devnexus&quot; class=&quot;margin10&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; style=&quot;max-width:50%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
So, my next bright idea was to enter Atlanta Startup Weekend in April of 2012, form a team of volunteers and pitch the presentation
tool that I used at DevNexus as a startup idea.
Unfortunately, the idea didn’t get picked, but I met 3 awesome developers who joined my team and those connections were huge wins. I
also made connections with many other like minded entrepreneurs, so overall my first time joining an event like this was priceless.
Again, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mikeschinkel/status/194207658033680384&quot;&gt;just putting myself out there&lt;/a&gt; was another way to level up...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 months into my contract at Cox (June), I was finally getting close to finishing my O’Reilly book. A lot of my effort was going
into the code examples in the book and the ideas behind it. So in June, I finally launched &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.html5e.org&quot;&gt;html5e.org&lt;/a&gt;.
This site contains a ton of examples and practical implementations of W3C and HTML5 apis. The basic idea behind html5e is to
defragment the mobile (and desktop) browser space by using a core set of APIs. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.html5e.org&quot;&gt;Read more here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 3 months with my consulting gig at Cox/Manheim, I received a call from the senior development director at CNN. He
had attended the same talk I gave at DevNexus 2012 (where I used my presentation tool), and wanted to know if I’d be
interested in joing the CNN.com development team. I was pretty happy with my contract at Cox, but after I asked what I’d
be working on, I couldn’t turn the offer down. He told me that I’d be working on the responsive re-design of CNN.com or
improving overall performance. Who wouldn’t jump at the chance to improve a site that gets 60 million uniques per day?
To say the least, I had been “primed” for interviews after my experiences with Square, Google, and Wikipedia so I felt
completely comfortable walking into my interview at CNN. Onsite, I took a 30 minute written exam and interviewed with 7
people. CNN does a great job of screening candidates. Luckily I made it through the screen and started the contract on
July 1st.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, just the interview practice alone had given me a great idea on the bar that the world’s top technology companies
set. It’s invaluable and I recommend everyone do it, especially if you’re a cocky, egotistical developer type who thinks
he/she is the hottest thing since Honey Boo-Boo :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure if you notice the pattern here, but somehow I managed to start jobs at the beginning of each quarter. No real
importance behind it, just thought it’s cool that it continues to happen throughout the entire year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was working at CNN, I immediately took the initiative
to look at how they were implementing their “share bar” or buttons that allowed visitors to share content through social media.
I also wanted to understand how Web Intents could possibly fit into the picture here.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://wesleyhales.com/blog/2012/07/11/Sharing-With-Web-Intents-Today/&quot;&gt;My findings&lt;/a&gt; were interesting enough to get some of the top
developers/authors/speakers in the industry to comment on my post. It really is motivating when you see your blog spike
from roughly 100 unique visitors a week to 1000's. I even got a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TwitterOSS/status/240912782000795649&quot;&gt;shout out&lt;/a&gt; on TwitterOSS :)
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.wesleyhales.com/images/posts/2012-11-01/blogstats.png&quot; alt=&quot;devnexus&quot; class=&quot;margin10 max-width-100&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next thing I worked on at CNN was page load performance. We started having meetings with CNN’s best and brightest to see what
we could do to add performance improvements to CNN’s home page. The problem with making changes like these in most large
organizations is that everything is product based. Therefore, you usually don’t have any internal sponsorship (or funds) to
make these kinds of changes. Fortunately for me, I was willing to take afternoons and downtime to work on the performance issues.
After taking a look at what could be done, we decided to break JQuery out of the concatenation process and far-future cache
it. That simple change alone Improved CNN.com performance by 17% and saved almost 1TB of outgoing data per day. You see,
CNN does regular interval releases like most folks and their main concatenated JS file is revved on each release. So users
had to re-download that file upon each visit after release.
Before we made the change, we had to have a way to measure the performance impact both before and after improvements were
made. Enter &lt;a href=&quot;http://phantomjs.org/&quot;&gt;PhantomJS&lt;/a&gt; - With phantomjs, we were able to create a script (later named &lt;a href=&quot;http://loadreport.wesleyhales.com/&quot;&gt;loadreport.js&lt;/a&gt;)
that would run for each development build. Thus, giving us a baseline for the changes we were making. For the full story behind loadreport.js,
check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://wesleyhales.com/blog/2012/08/16/Site-Load-Time-Testing-with-PhantomJS/&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;.
On August 16th, loadreport was picked up in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://javascriptweekly.com/archive/92.html&quot;&gt;JavaScript weekly newsletter&lt;/a&gt; and again, blog spikes were abundant :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is, I don’t give a damn who you’re working for and what you’re doing; just blog about it. If you want to get better, write about it.
Find something to write about if you’re working on boring shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My time at CNN was a lot of fun and I met some really talented developers. I had no intentions of leaving this job and planned
on staying there for my full contract length, BUT.... one day I got a call. The call came from an good friend and colleague
that I had previously helped to bootstrap a startup. I was actually the third co-founder of this startup, but I had to back out
due to all the craziness that you just read about (and more). But I still had a vested interest in the company and we parted ways on good terms.
So, I was told that they had just been &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.apigee.com/apigee_acquires_instaops_embracing_the_apps_everywhere_world&quot;&gt;acquired&lt;/a&gt; by
a startup in Palo Alto called &lt;a href=&quot;http://apigee.com&quot;&gt;Apigee&lt;/a&gt; and he wanted me to come pick up where I left off.
On October 1, I started full time employment with Apigee and I couldn't be happier. I had the opportunity of taking &lt;a href=&quot;http://wesleyhales.com/design/?p=design&quot;&gt;my original UI&lt;/a&gt;
and integrating it with Apigee’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://apigee.com/about/mobile-analytics&quot;&gt;look and feel&lt;/a&gt; amongst many other things. This has
really been the icing on top - the cherries come in the following section - of an incredible 1 year journey. I'm looking forward to
doing many great things with Apigee's technology and the future of the web applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve Jobs said it best in 2005, when he told those Stanford students to “Stay hungry. Stay foolish”. Even though I
could stand to lose about 10-15 pounds. I have stayed foolish and I listened to my heart on what I should do. I constantly
had butterflies in my stomach and was pushed to the very edge of the stress levels that I could handle. That is how I
knew I was doing something worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On October 26th, my O’Reilly book is done and was sent to the printer. It is now available as an &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024088.do&quot;&gt;ebook&lt;/a&gt;
and will be available in print on November 12th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On November 1st (today), the idea that I helped create and shape got it’s first &lt;a href=&quot;http://finance.yahoo.com/news/apigee-launches-first-real-time-120000461.html&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;http://apigee.com/about/mobile-analytics&quot;&gt;official public launch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.wesleyhales.com/images/posts/2012-11-01/apigee.png&quot; alt=&quot;apigee mobile analytics&quot; class=&quot;margin10 max-width-100&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be speaking at a few more conferences in November, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Wesley+Hales&quot;&gt;Devoxx&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;http://therichwebexperience.com/conference/speaker/wesley_hales&quot;&gt;RWX&lt;/a&gt;, and after that I’m going to lay low for a while.
The amount of stress that I’ve undergone over the past year is not for the faint of heart. Imagine trying to prove yourself
to a new team of developers and managers every 90 days. On top of that, they all knew that I authored a book, so some people
expect you to shit rainbows at times. Managing expectations can be a bit tricky as well. So I have my acid reflux medicine now,
I can sleep pretty well after a couple of beers, and I won’t have to pay for many more haircuts as my hair falls out at an even faster rate :)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Web Performance Testing With PhantomJS</title>

      HTTP requests, heavy/unminified resources, and UI thread blocking should be on the mind of every front-end developer. These
      are just a few issues that can cause serious bottlenecks in page load times. Having a faster load time equals better search engine
      rankings, higher conversion rates, and an overall reduction in bandwidth costs.

are just a few issues that can cause serious bottlenecks in page load times. Having a faster load time equals better search engine
rankings, higher conversion rates, and an overall reduction in bandwidth costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently took on the task of coming up with an accurate way to measure all the aforementioned things, in an effort to understand
which performance tweaks improved page load times and which ones didn't. But first, we needed a baseline to test how fast the page loads with both a clear-cache and primed-cache state; Enter PhantomJS.
PhantomJS gives us a way to headlessly test page performance, and also gives us the automation we need for integration with any build system.
For this article, I will explain the reporting tool I used and try to give you a starting point for testing your own site(s).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, I started with James Pierce's &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jamesgpearce/confess/&quot;&gt;confess.js&lt;/a&gt; which gives us the elapsed load
time of a web page, the slowest and fastest resources, along with many other cool things like automatic generation of an appcache manifest. However, it did not give us
the document.readyState=interactive/complete or window.onload times. Another thing I wanted to measure was before and after cache. So If at first,
we have resources which are not far-future cached, what happens after we future cache these things? Also, how fast does our page load after
 being cached?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a few performance focused modifications to confess.js, we are able to gather the following results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;document.readyState&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;image filmstrip (how the page looks over load time)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;page and resource load times after the user has a primed cache.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pretty effin cool charts with sparklines fed by knockout.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This script is running live at &lt;a href=&quot;http://loadreport.wesleyhales.com/report.html&quot;&gt;loadreport.wesleyhales.com/report.html&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.wesleyhales.com/images/loadreport.js.png&quot; alt=&quot;loadreport.js&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; class=&quot;max-width-100&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're running the test 5 times in a row, to give an average of your best load times and to see where spikes occur. Also, &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/ryanbridges&quot;&gt;@ryanbridges&lt;/a&gt; put together
some awesome sparkline charts backed by knockout.js. Just click on the &quot;Show Me Some Charts!&quot; button to see 'em.
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.wesleyhales.com/images/loadreport-charts.png&quot; alt=&quot;loadreport-charts&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; class=&quot;max-width-100 margin10&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding cache performance, phantomjs has a --disk-cahe=yes switch which is supposed to enable caching, but the results on the number
of resources loaded and their size seem to be reversed. For example, if we run this script against cnn.com with --disk-cahe=yes, phantom returns
over 2MB of resources, but if we run it with the same switch set to &quot;no&quot;, we get 858KB of resources - and both modes report the same number
of resources being loaded (around 150).
To bypass this bug, I've created my own caching mechanism which basically loads the same page twice (in the same phantom instance)
 and returns more accurate results when compared with Chrome's developer tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install &lt;a href=&quot;http://phantomjs.org/&quot;&gt;phantomjs&lt;/a&gt; 1.6+, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wesleyhales/loadreport&quot;&gt;Get the script here&lt;/a&gt; and run this on your own build servers to make sure your UI screams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/wesleyhales&quot;&gt;@wesleyhales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This is why HTML5 is the #1 job trend on indeed.com and is the fastest growing keyword found in online job postings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When I started this user group exactly 11 months ago, I wasn't sure how far it would grow and had no idea who would be the following month's speaker. When you start a group (or any venture for that matter) completely unaware of who will show up and who will continue to come, regardless of the subject's popularity, it's easy to become a little unsure of yourself. Luckily, I had awesome friends and supporters from day one who helped the group become what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a firm believer in open source and giving everything away. It all comes back to you in multiple ways in the end. On that note, this group will never charge for an event or sell out as a platform for selling a product or service. I have turned down many cash offers from quite a few promoters/sales people who wish to use this community for their benefit and not give anything back to it. However, we will accept sponsorship of any company that wishes to help us bring in bigger speakers or generally support the group for equipment and other costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So thanks to all who have supported the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/AtlantaHTML5/&quot;&gt;Atlanta HTML5 User Group&lt;/a&gt;. I'm not sure what will happen when HTML6 comes out, but we will have to think of another clever name ;)&lt;/p&gt;

      The Intent of Sharing
      
      
      If you employ share buttons on your site, then you might already be aware of the increased load that comes with trying
      to make your content social. Allowing users to take action on your specific content and "share" it is a common task.
      Much like linking HTML documents together, we are now linking apps together that are capable of
       pushing content to a receiving service via the user. This action or intent of "sharing" content across different apps
       has recently been identified in a W3C Editors Draft called Web Intents.

&lt;h3&gt;The Intent of Sharing&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you employ share buttons on your site, then you might already be aware of the increased load that comes with trying
to make your content social. Allowing users to take action on your specific content and &quot;share&quot; it is a common task.
Much like linking HTML documents together, we are now linking apps together that are capable of
 pushing content to a receiving service via the user. This action or intent of &quot;sharing&quot; content across different apps
 has recently been identified in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/web-intents/raw-file/tip/spec/Overview.html&quot;&gt;W3C Editors Draft called Web Intents&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently took a job working on &lt;a href=&quot;http://cnn.com&quot;&gt;CNN.com&lt;/a&gt; and I'm sure you can imagine that the weight and performance of social sharing is pretty serious 'round these parts.
So I will break down the current state of sharing as it exists today, then jump into an examination of Web Intents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Why do we need Web Intents? &lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In today's world of sharing we have limited options.
(Note that the &quot;share&quot; intent is one of many. You can also edit, save, etc... but this article is focused on sharing)
We are forced to pull a JavaScript file and load a share button dynamically for the user, or we can encode a query string that will
be the input on a GET request to the provided share service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this example, I've taken the most widely used social networks as an example. Each is linked to a simple HTML page that only contains
their specific resources to display a share button for the given service:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wesleyhales.com/examples/shares/twitter/&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wesleyhales.com/examples/shares/google/&quot;&gt;Google+&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wesleyhales.com/examples/shares/fb/&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wesleyhales.com/examples/shares/linkedin/&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;First, I wanted a true measurement on all the resources and page load times without anything in the cache.
So I cleared the browser cache and loaded a single test page (from the list above) for each share service provider. Here are the results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;container&quot; class=&quot;max-width-100&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I know... seems pretty crazy that Facebook would have 11 HTTP requests and a 135KB payload (after compress/GZIP) for a share/like button.
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.wesleyhales.com/images/design/share-buttons/facebook.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;Facebook resources&quot; class=&quot;max-width-100 margin10&quot; /&gt;
LinkedIn is delivering 80KB of stuff, Twitter comes in right at 40KB, and although Google only serves up 2KB of resources, the data is broken up over 10 HTTP requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that we are on a desktop browser, so worrying about all the HTTP requests may be a little nonsensical. But, on a mobile
browser this is definitely something you should be concerned about.
The previous no-cache scenario is a unique, one time case for our users. And chances are, your user's browser may have already
cached this content from another site using the same button resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, after we load all the resources for the first time, surely those will be better cached via local/sessionStorage and
optimized for fast load times and modern browsers, right? WRONG!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On page refresh we get the following results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;container2&quot; class=&quot;max-width-100&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here we see that there are no files being cached outside of the browsers default capabilities. Render times are still staying fairly consistent with the previous times, with the exception of Twitter, which
was cut down to more than half of it's no-cache onload time.
HTTP requests remain mostly the same, and sizes are a little better, but LinkedIn is still chiming in at 45KB... on each page load/refresh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, when we click the share button for each provider, we get the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;container3&quot; class=&quot;max-width-100&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Ok, so we see something interesting here. Google is the only one who did lazy loading! \o/ Thanks Google! The additional 2KB
of downloaded content creates the Google+ UI on the fly, but at a cost of 29 HTTP requests. Yes, that's right, 29.
I didn't look very closely as to why LinkedIn updates the parent DOM, but your page has been abused pretty badly at
this point so it probably doesn't matter too much :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with all of this data, we can clearly see that today's DIY sharing intents are raping our applications pretty hard. We have no idea what
those resources are doing and they come at a high cost. Aside from the issues of resource weight, back doors, and inefficient architecture of sharing services, there are many other issues
 with the current ways we handle the sharing of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Alternatives&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The best alternative that works across browsers today is a simple share URL. Throw in some kick ass, responsive &lt;a href=&quot;http://gregoryloucas.github.com/Font-Awesome-More/#all-icons&quot;&gt;font icons&lt;/a&gt;
 and we have a performant way to share content. But there are still a few problems with this approach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are faced with a potential list of
social networks and options that our users may not even use or care about. We've all seen it before, it's the typical &quot;share bar&quot; found on most major
news sites and blogs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don't have any way of receiving a callback on whether the post/share was successful or not. The only way to get this data is through async analytics
by emedding a unique identifier in the URL. Then hope the referrer surfaces in next months usage reports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here are the corresponding share URLs from the providers analyzed above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.linkedin.com/documents/share-linkedin&quot;&gt;LinkedIn:&lt;/a&gt; http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url={articleUrl}&amp;title={articleTitle}&amp;summary={articleSummary}&amp;source={articleSource}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.twitter.com/docs/intents&quot;&gt;Twitter:&lt;/a&gt; https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url={articleURL} &lt;-- Notice the &quot;/intent/&quot;? We'll get to that in a bit.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.twitter.com/docs/intents&quot;&gt;Google+:&lt;/a&gt; https://plus.google.com/share?url={articleURL}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Web Intents&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you're still struggling to wrap your head around Web Intents, you're not alone. I had to sit down and run through the latest &lt;a href=&quot;http://intentlab-io12.appspot.com/&quot;&gt;Google IO 2012 code exercises&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1YjdKh-rPg&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded#!&quot;&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smartjava.org/content/html5-web-intents-share-information-between-web-apps&quot;&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; on Web Intents to really see how it is currently implemented and what it takes to make it work. As of this writing, the only
browser supporting the &lt;code&gt;WebKitIntent&lt;/code&gt; api is, you guessed it, WebKit. This includes Chrome versions &gt;= 19. But, even though the tag is supported, you must install
a Chrome extension to actually fulfill the intent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we see what happens when I click a Web Intent enabled button for sharing an image. You can try it out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wesleyhales.com/examples/shares/intent/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.wesleyhales.com/images/design/webintent-pick.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;web intent pick&quot; class=&quot;max-width-100 margin10&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point you are probably wondering: How do we get the dialogue to show up in teh browser? How can we register an application to handle this request?
The plan is to allow web applications to register themselves through a provided JavaScript api or HTML tag when the specification is
final. For now, we must use a Chrome extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a section pulled from the manifest file in the extension I'm using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full-width clear&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;#x000A;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;#x000A;&quot;intents&quot;: {&amp;#x000A;      &quot;http://webintents.org/save&quot; : {&amp;#x000A;      &quot;type&quot;: [&quot;image/jpg&quot;, &quot;image/jpeg&quot;, &quot;image/png&quot;, &quot;image/gif&quot;],&amp;#x000A;      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;PicStore&quot;,&amp;#x000A;      &quot;path&quot;: &quot;save.html&quot;,&amp;#x000A;      &quot;disposition&quot;: &quot;inline&quot;&amp;#x000A;    },&amp;#x000A;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To put it simply, this is how you register an application (Chrome extension) to be used as a Web Intent today. By using the namespace
defined on the first line &quot;http://webintents.org/save&quot;, we can assign our intent to be handled by any app who has this namespace and accepts the supplied &quot;type&quot;.
The &quot;path&quot; is just another HTML file which is included in my extension and the code on that page will handle the intent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our client application, where the intent originates from, we call the following code onclick to allow the user to choose an application
to fulfill this intent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full-width clear&quot;&gt;
&lt;code /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;#x000A;function invoke() {&amp;#x000A;    var intent = new WebKitIntent({&amp;#x000A;        &quot;action&quot;:&quot;http://webintents.org/save&quot;,&amp;#x000A;        &quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/*&quot;,&amp;#x000A;        &quot;suggestions&quot;:[&quot;http://webintents.org/save&quot;,&quot;http://webintents.org/pick&quot;],&amp;#x000A;        &quot;data&quot;:location.href});&amp;#x000A;&amp;#x000A;    var onSuccess = function(data) { alert(data) };&amp;#x000A;    var onError = function(data) { alert(data) };&amp;#x000A;&amp;#x000A;    window.navigator.webkitStartActivity(intent, onSuccess, onError);&amp;#x000A;}&amp;#x000A;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Web Intents are a really good solution to the problems I mentioned in the first part of this article. I'm sure there are many kinks
which will be ironed out in upcoming revisions to the spec, but overall it seems like a nice fit as we transition to the &quot;browser as a platform&quot;
and find new ways of linking data and applications.
As I said earlier, the plan is to allow any web application to register itself in the browser/UserAgent and I'm assuming some kind of user approval will go along with that.
The proposed way of registering an application is with the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;intent&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag:
&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;#x000A;&amp;lt;intent&amp;#x000A;  action=&quot;http://webintents.org/share&quot;&amp;#x000A;  type=&quot;image/*&quot;&amp;#x000A;  href=&quot;share.html&quot;&amp;#x000A;  disposition=&quot;window|inline&quot;&amp;#x000A; /&amp;gt;&amp;#x000A;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
Until this is implemented across browsers, all we have is the Chrome Web Store and extensions to take advantage of this technology.
Read more about the details of Web Intents &lt;a href=&quot;http://webintents.org&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Note - Twitter has made the best attempt at an early implementation of Web Intents. The best thing service providers can do today, is follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.twitter.com/docs/intents&quot;&gt;Twitter's implementation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a full example on how to create a Web Intent Chrome extension, run through the examples in &lt;a href=&quot;http://intentlab-io12.appspot.com/&quot;&gt;this Google IO lab at #IO12&lt;/a&gt;.
Or you can try it out with Chrome 19+ and the simple demo I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wesleyhales.com/examples/shares/intent/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      Getting the browser version from the User Agent string is one thing. But, when you
force compatibility mode in IE, you get whatever version you're forcing to. e.g...

to return "8" :(

I started digging through some msdn docs to find various
ways of sniffing the actual browser we're using, even when compatibility mode is forced. This led me to this doc
Which talks about how IE9's Chakra JavaScript engine processes math precision differently (and faster) than the old IE8 JScript engine.

      I ran into a situation this weekend where certain pages of a PhoneGap application were incredibly choppy on iOS versions pre 4.3.x.
Apparently, there is a problem with older browsers using CSS3 selectors like div[style*='foo'] in combination with other DOM elements.


The test case was a little tricky to create, seeing that pinpointing this problem required mucho testing.
However, I minimized the markup and CSS to only a few classes and DOM elements. The choppy scrolling is caused by a combination of inline
styles, an ordered list, a table with a lot of rows, and the use of the specific CSS3 [style*='foo'] selector.

      The AeroGear project had it's official launch last week and I want to review what we're doing and where we're headed. For starters, AeroGear is focused on:
        
          Education - Screencasts, Tutorials, and Quickstarts for running any (HTML5, Hybrid, Native) mobile solution with JBoss projects and app servers.
          Innovation - Many of AeroGear's primary goals are to provide HTML5 extensions for web applications, both mobile and desktop based.

&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jboss.org/aerogear&quot;&gt;AeroGear project&lt;/a&gt; had it's official launch last week and I want to review what we're doing and where we're headed. For starters, AeroGear is focused on:
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://community.jboss.org/wiki/AeroGearServerSideResources&quot;&gt;Education&lt;/a&gt; - Screencasts, Tutorials, and Quickstarts for running any (HTML5, Hybrid, Native) mobile solution with JBoss projects and app servers.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://community.jboss.org/wiki/AeroGearHTML5ExtensionConcepts&quot;&gt;Innovation&lt;/a&gt; - Many of AeroGear's primary goals are to provide HTML5 extensions for web applications, both mobile and desktop based.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://community.jboss.org/wiki/ContributingToAeroGear&quot;&gt;Community&lt;/a&gt; - We already have several community members contributing examples, demos, and other useful resources. We want to hear from &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.jboss.org/en/aerogear?view=discussions&quot;&gt;you&lt;/a&gt;! We're here for the community.'&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  Most front-end developers are familiar with &quot;jQuery callbacks and RESTful services&quot;, but all developers should be familiar with how this architecture affects their end of the stack. So we put together the following diagram which explains the concept of &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.jboss.org/wiki/POH5PlainOldHTML5Applications&quot;&gt;&quot;POH5&quot; (Plain Old HTML5)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.wesleyhales.com/images/design/poh5.flow.expanded.png&quot; alt=&quot;Poh5.Flow.Expanded&quot; class=&quot;max-width-100&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So why another acronym? Why not just call it &quot;Plain Old Open Web&quot;? The HTML5 revolution causes developers to think differently about their overall architecture, with more JavaScript and CSS on the client-side and RESTful endpoints on the server-side. AeroGear hopes to bridge this gap and provide the tools or &quot;gear&quot; you need to get started quickly with the best possible solution.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
We're just getting started... For now, we have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aerogear/as-quickstarts/tree/master/kitchensink-html5-mobile&quot;&gt;quickstart application&lt;/a&gt; which &lt;a href&quot;https://community.jboss.org/wiki/GetStartedWithHTML5MobileWebDevelopmentWithJBoss#Prerequisites&quot;&gt;fully examines each piece of the POH5 architecture. Take it for a spin with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://poh5-aerogear.rhcloud.com/&quot;&gt;live demo&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://community.jboss.org/en/aerogear?view=documents&quot;&gt;Join Us&lt;/a&gt;! or come hang out on &lt;a href=&quot;irc://irc.freenode.net/aerogear&quot;&gt;freenode #aerogear&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Pushing CDI Events to the Browser with WebSockets</title>

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  
&lt;p&gt;Here is the demo in action. As you can see on the right, I have 2 chat windows open and on the left we have a member registration. Users are chatting across a raw WebSocket connection and when another user registers, the CDI event is fired all the way through to the browser as a JavaScript alert via the connected WebSocket clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://player.vimeo.com/video/35433707?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  
With WebSockets, we have a new development model for server side applications; event based programming. There are 3 out-of-box events associated with WebSockets: onopen, onmessage, and onclose. For starters, we must wire up these three listeners to utilize the core functionality that the WebSocket specification gives us. The open event is fired when the WebSocket connection is opened successfully. The message event is fired when the server sends data. The close event is fired when the WebSocket connection is closed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/1651079.js?file=websocketBasic.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But sending messages in the form of strings over raw WebSockets isn't very appealing when we're wanting to develop advanced web applications. Obviously, we're going to be using JSON to transfer data to and from the server. But how do we propagate our CDI events which are fired on the server and have them bubble up on the client?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, we'll start with the server. I'm using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jboss.org/jbossas/downloads/&quot;&gt;JBoss AS7 application server&lt;/a&gt; and embedding &lt;a href=&quot;http://eclipse.org/jetty/&quot;&gt;Jetty&lt;/a&gt; within my web application. Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://angelozerr.wordpress.com/2011/07/26/websockets_jetty_step4/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, I was able to easily add the latest Jetty server to my maven project (dependencies below) to get everything up and running in a few minutes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A few things worth noting:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security: Since our WebSocket server is running on a different port (8081) than our AS7 server (8080), we must account for not having the ability to share cookies, etc...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proxies: As if proxy servers weren't already a huge problem for running WebSockets and HTTP over the same port, we are now running the separately (but I have a semi-solution for this below)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Threading: Since we're observing/listening for CDI events, we must perform some thread same operations and connection sharing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, if you're still reading ;) let's get on with the code.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Download the latest &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jboss.org/jbossas/downloads/&quot;&gt;JBoss AS7 (7.1.0.CR1b as of this writing)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Add the Jetty maven dependencies to your project. This demo is based off of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jbossas/quickstart/tree/master/html5-mobile&quot;&gt;original html5-mobile quickstart for JBoss AS7&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/1651079.js?file=pom.xml&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Next we setup the WebSocket server using Jetty's WebSocketHandler and embedding it inside a ServletContextListener.
Here we're sharing a synchronized set of WebSocket connections across threads. Using the synchronized keyword, we ensure that only a single thread can execute a method or block at one time. The ChatWebSocketHandler contains a global Set of webSocket connections and adds each new connection as it's made within the Jetty server
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wesleyhales/HTML5-Mobile-WebSocket/tree/master/src/main/java/org/jboss/as/quickstarts/html5_mobile/websockets&quot;&gt;View complete source here.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/1651079.js?file=ChatWebSocketHandler.java&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/1651079.js?file=ChatServerServletContextListener.java&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now we'll create a method to observe CDI events and send the fired &quot;Member&quot; events to all active connections.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/1651079.js?file=ChatWebSocketHandler-observer.java&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The above code will observe the following event when a new Member is registered through the web interface.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/1651079.js?file=MemberService.java&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Finally, we setup our WebSocket JavaScript client and safely avoid using the eval() method to execute the received JavaScript.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/1651079.js?file=websocketclient.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here is the JavaScript code which listens for our CDI event, and executes the necessary client side code. (This is the alert popup seen in the video above.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/1651079.js?file=cdiJavascriptListener.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;One additional piece I added to this approach is the use of HAProxy. This gives us a reverse-proxy on the WebSocket port (8081), in the end allowing all traffic (HTTP and ws/wss) to be sent across a central port - 8080 in this case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/1651079.js?file=haproxy.config&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As you can see, this is a very prototyped approach to achieve $SUBJECT, but it's a step forward in adding a usable programming layer on top of the WebSocket protocol. There's probably a few framework out there which try to provide a programming model on top of WebSockets, so leave comments if you know of any.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I want to thank the people who have supported me and helped me achieve these things. There are too many to list, but you know who you are. I’m starting to realize that technology and trends are irrelevant. The thing that matters most are the people and communities behind them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common approach for receiving markup from an Ajax request is to use innerHTML for placement of the responseText. This method has been widely used (and argued) since the inception of XHR, but it surprises me that it's still being recommended and used not only on desktop browsers but mobile ones as well.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;3 or 4 years have passed since many folks raised their concerns with innerHTML:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From Javascript The Good Parts:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If the HTML text contains a &amp;lt;script&amp;gt; tag or its equivalent, then an evil script will run. .. This danger is a direct consequence of JavaScript&amp;rsquo;s global object which is far and away the worst part of JavaScript&amp;rsquo;s many bad parts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Not only is innerHTML bad, it is the root cause of many problems... from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.julienlecomte.net/blog/2007/12/38/&quot;&gt;browser memory leaks&lt;/a&gt; (it destroys/replaces existing elements that may have event handlers attached) to &lt;a href=&quot;http://martinkou.blogspot.com/2011/05/alternative-workaround-for-mobile.html&quot;&gt;failing completely&lt;/a&gt; on iOS&amp;rsquo;s Mobile Safari. Yes, that's right, it just flakes out.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So even if you use &lt;a href=&quot;http://javascript.crockford.com/memory/leak.html&quot;&gt;Crockford&amp;rsquo;s purge&lt;/a&gt; method to fix the memory leaks and sanitize your response string returned from the server, you still have a showstopping flaw when running any mobile web solution that uses innerHTML on iOS devices &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Just to name a few mobile frameworks that use this flawed innerHTML approach:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://api.jquery.com/html/&quot;&gt;JQuery Mobile&lt;/a&gt; (uses jQuery&amp;rsquo;s .html() wich is a wrapper for innerHTML)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;active_link&quot; href=&quot;http://wiki.phonegap.com/w/page/42450600/PhoneGap%20Ajax%20Sample&quot;&gt;Phone Gap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sencha.com/forum/showthread.php?122591-List-rendering-race-condition&quot;&gt;Sencha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A possible solution:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We all know that innerHTML is a favorite for it&amp;rsquo;s speed and ease of use but speed doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter when it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work at all. So one solution is through use of some new features in HTML5 and the DOM api:&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the scenario that you've made your XHR and received the responseText. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;First thing we'll do is create a temporary iFrame element. This isn't any ordinary iframe, it received a major security enhancement with HTML5 and we have some new sanitizing features with the &quot;sandbox&quot; attribute. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-author-view/the-iframe-element.html#attr-iframe-sandbox&quot;&gt;spec&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #808080;&quot;&gt;The sandbox attribute, when specified, enables a set of extra restrictions on any content hosted by the iframe. Its value must be an unordered set of unique space-separated tokens that are ASCII case-insensitive. The allowed values are allow-forms, allow-same-origin, allow-scripts, and allow-top-navigation. When the attribute is set, the content is treated as being from a unique origin, forms and scripts are disabled, links are prevented from targeting other browsing contexts, and plugins are disabled. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;To limit the damage that can be caused by hostile HTML content, it should be served using the &lt;strong&gt;text/html-sandboxed&lt;/strong&gt; MIME type.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;pre class=&quot;jive_text_macro jive_macro_code&quot; jivemacro=&quot;code&quot; ___default_attr=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;function getFrame() {&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    var frame = document.getElementById(&quot;temp-frame&quot;);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    if (!frame) {&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;        // create frame&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;        frame = document.createElement(&quot;iframe&quot;);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;        frame.setAttribute(&quot;id&quot;, &quot;temp-frame&quot;);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;        frame.setAttribute(&quot;name&quot;, &quot;temp-frame&quot;);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;        frame.setAttribute(&quot;seamless&quot;, &quot;&quot;);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;        frame.setAttribute(&quot;sandbox&quot;, &quot;&quot;);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;        frame.style.display = 'none';&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;        document.documentElement.appendChild(frame);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    }&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    return frame.contentDocument;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Now, we get our ajax response and write it to the iframe:&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;pre class=&quot;jive_text_macro jive_macro_code&quot; jivemacro=&quot;code&quot; ___default_attr=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;var frame = getFrame();&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;frame.write(responseText);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The beauty of this solution is the fact that we don't have to deal with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://ejohn.org/blog/pure-javascript-html-parser&quot;&gt;javascript text to DOM parser&lt;/a&gt;. We're allowing the browser to do what it does best... parse the HTML and build a DOM. And we don't have to worry about parsing the response and removing a blacklist of prohibited security risk elements and other XSS hacking pitas.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;After writing the response to the iframe, you now have a ready to use sanitized DOM. Next you can use the DOM API to grab any part of the new document.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;pre class=&quot;jive_text_macro jive_macro_code&quot; jivemacro=&quot;code&quot; ___default_attr=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; var incomingElements = frame.getElementsByClassName('elementClassName');&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Safari correctly refuses to implicitly move a node from one document to another. An error is raised if the new child node was created in a different document. So here we use adoptNode to add the incomingElements to our existing page.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;pre class=&quot;jive_text_macro jive_macro_code&quot; jivemacro=&quot;code&quot; ___default_attr=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; document.getElementById(elementId).appendChild(document.adoptNode(incomingElements));&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The only thing left to do now is benchmarking. As I said earlier, working with the DOM has been notably slower than using innerHTML in the past. So there may be a derivative of this proposed solution that is faster? or there may not be a huge difference in execution time? Let me know....&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p class=&quot;pTitle&quot;&gt;Day 3: About The Design&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
      Here we have another phone based design broke out into 3 pages.&lt;br /&gt; 
      &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wesleyhales.com/images/jroller/rf.phone.day3.page1.JPG&quot;&gt;The first page&lt;/a&gt; is a standard menu so not much to say there. The bottom menu bar is a little different from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wesleyhales.com/entry/going_mobile_with_richfaces_we&quot;&gt;my first design&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; following the lead of the native twitter iPhone app.&lt;br /&gt; 
      &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wesleyhales.com/images/jroller/rf.phone.day3.page1.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;RichFace Mobile Skin1&quot; src=&quot;http://www.wesleyhales.com/images/jroller/rf.phone.day3.page1.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
      As you can see with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wesleyhales.com/images/jroller/rf.phone.day3.page2.JPG&quot;&gt;second page&lt;/a&gt; (below), this is not a standard accordion panel type of component. When you touch an option from page one, the accordion expands on a different page and only focuses on that specific panel. Not sure if it could work, but accordion collapse/expand style of components don&amp;#8216;t make a ton of sense to me on limited screen real estate.&lt;br /&gt; 
      &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wesleyhales.com/images/jroller/rf.phone.day3.page2.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin:0 7px 0 0;&quot; alt=&quot;RichFace Mobile Skin1&quot; src=&quot;http://www.wesleyhales.com/images/jroller/rf.phone.day3.page2.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
      So after you go through the menu options and decide on a component, you are taken to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wesleyhales.com/images/jroller/rf.phone.day3.page3.JPG&quot;&gt;detail/demo screen&lt;/a&gt;(below) where you can play around with your component of choice.&lt;/p&gt; 
      
      &lt;p&gt;Note the small orange page marker dots at the bottom. The user would have the ability to flip through each component in the given section by swiping horizontally.&lt;br /&gt; 
      &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wesleyhales.com/images/jroller/rf.phone.day3.page3.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin:0 7px 0 0;&quot; alt=&quot;RichFace Mobile Skin1&quot; src=&quot;http://www.wesleyhales.com/images/jroller/rf.phone.day3.page3.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

      Day 2 of the RichFaces skinning and we have the first approach for tablet devices. Tablets are a little harder to design for because of a few reasons: 
      
      1) Your design sits on the fine line between desktop and mobile. You are designing your app for a max 1024 pixel resolution (in landscape mode) but you must also take advantage of mobile usability (which you will see in page2)

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Day 2 of the RichFaces skinning and we have the first approach for tablet devices. Tablets are a little harder to design for because of a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;1) Your design sits on the fine line between desktop and mobile. You are designing your app for a max 1024 pixel resolution (in landscape mode) but you must also take advantage of mobile usability (which you will see in page2)&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;2) Similar to the iPad Mail.app, it&amp;#8216;s almost like you are designing 2 different UI&amp;#8216;s for landscape and portrait modes. For portrait you need more drop down menus, and for landscape you can try to fit everything on one page without the drop downs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wesleyhales.com/images/jroller/rf.tablet.day2.page1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;RichFace Mobile Skin1&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;225px&quot; src=&quot;http://www.wesleyhales.com/images/jroller/rf.tablet.day2.page1-small.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;pTitle&quot;&gt;Day 2: About The Design&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
Here we have the interaction broken out into 2 pages. The first page shows the primary menu and isn&amp;#8216;t all that exciting.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Notice how, unlike the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wesleyhales.com/entry/going_mobile_with_richfaces_we&quot;&gt;iphone design from Day 1&lt;/a&gt;, I left the browser button overrides within the app itself. Tablet web apps are completely use case driven so this will vary. But since we have so much more real estate, we can play around with standard navigation options that keep the user's attention focused on the app itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wesleyhales.com/images/jroller/rf.tablet.day2.page2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin:0 7px 0 0;&quot; alt=&quot;RichFace Mobile Skin1&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; width=&quot;225px&quot; src=&quot;http://www.wesleyhales.com/images/jroller/rf.tablet.day2.page2-small.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
The second page is what you see after selecting a menu item from page 1 (click to enlarge). Here we have the title bar at the top left with a built in back button which takes the user back to the first screen.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;To the right of the title you see the secondary menu represented by rounded rectangles. Next is the main content of the page broken out into content and actionable panels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally you have the big arrows to the right and left. These arrows are &amp;#8220;thumb reachable&amp;#8221; which is a common usability pattern in portrait mode tablets. It provides an easy page flip access to all of the RichFaces components within the top level category.&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The great thing about CSS3 transitions is that you can really make a UI like this scream and flow seamlessly. So you can imagine how tapping an arrow with your thumb will slide in a new component demo and gracefully highlight the secondary menu option at the top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So this concludes our design for Day 2. As I said earlier, this is more of a use case driven design. WE could spawn a very minimalistic skin and component look and feel from this. However, It would be more to display the power behind RichFaces ajax and templating features as the user moves through the app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today marks an important day in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jboss.org/richfaces&quot;&gt;RichFaces project&lt;/a&gt; as we continue to head down the mobile web road. Since we have such a great community of users and followers, we want you to be involved with the design process.&lt;br /&gt; 
So each day this week, I will come up with a new proposed design/theme for RichFaces Mobile and we want to hear your feedback. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will announce each new design (both for tablet and phone) via &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/#!/richfaces&quot;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; with a link back to this article. I will try my best to pick apart each design and describe why I did what I did, and hope you can give me some real world feedback. We want this project to actually make sense and be usable to what you guys are facing in the real world. Without further adieu....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wesleyhales.com/images/jroller/rf-mobile-skin1.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;RichFace Mobile Skin1&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;200px&quot; src=&quot;http://www.wesleyhales.com/images/jroller/rf-mobile-skin1-small.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Our first task is to tackle the RichFaces showcase of components. Classifying what is mobile ready and which components may need a little work.&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;pTitle&quot;&gt;Day 1: About The Design&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
Here we have what could be the RichFaces component showcase skin. This is what I will be posting a new version of each day this week.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;In this design we have the standard browser “functionality take over” at the top header. The custom back button is essential to mobile web design and must be overridden here &amp;#8211; following the pattern of previous designs.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Nothing too different about the standard menu options and detail options (center stage). Following convention here as well. One thing I am adhering too are the usability guidelines set forth by Jakob Nielsen&amp;#8216;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nngroup.com/reports/mobile/ipad/&quot;&gt;Usability of iPad Apps and Websites&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;To get the full tab bar at the bottom (and to replicate the native feel) the user must bookmark the application. I think it makes sense for this menu to be contextual to the app and provide other alternate routes.&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;July 1st marked my first day on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jboss.org/richfaces&quot;&gt;JBoss RichFaces&lt;/a&gt; team. I've decided to push myself and get out of my comfort zone. It seems that a developer only has so many years that he or she can sustain the same position doing the same thing and dealing with the same technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been with Red Hat almost 4 years now and have enjoyed every second of it, and this is the first time in my career that I have chosen the position for myself while working within a company. It’s usually the other way around - as you are either picked for your skills and talent to work on a specific team or for whatever reason you are just told to move to another team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for my new position, I have been designated to serve on JBoss’ mobile working group (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_team&quot;&gt;Tiger Team&lt;/a&gt;). I will be part time on the actual RichFaces project (making the project work on mobile devices) and the other part heavily focused on HTML5 and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Web&quot;&gt;Mobile Web&lt;/a&gt;. This is a new frontier for developers as we try to create HTML5/CSS3 based web apps that not only match the native app feel but also answer the question “How can we make the mobile web faster using JBoss middleware?”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As things grow, so will the project and the team. I find excitement in bringing grass roots projects &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jboss.org/portletbridge&quot;&gt;from nothing into full blown enterprise supported products&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://www.jroller.com/images/smileys/wink.gif&quot; class=&quot;smiley&quot; alt=&quot;;)&quot; title=&quot;;)&quot; /&gt; Luckily I was in the right place at the right time and I must say that it was quite an honor to be allowed to make such a move. I’m looking forward to making good stuff happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      
      
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Stay tuned&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
