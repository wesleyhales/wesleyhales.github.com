                <p><p>So I made it over the hump of this mobile design week of madness. Below you will find a dark theme with a component skin for the rich:accordion component.</p><p><br /> 
                <p class="pTitle">Day 3: About The Design</p><br /> 
                Here we have another phone based design broke out into 3 pages.<br /> 
                <a href="/images/jroller/rf.phone.day3.page1.JPG">The first page</a> is a standard menu so not much to say there. The bottom menu bar is a little different from <a href="http://www.wesleyhales.com/entry/going_mobile_with_richfaces_we">my first design</a> &#8211; following the lead of the native twitter iPhone app.<br /> 
                <a href="/images/jroller/rf.phone.day3.page1.JPG"><img alt="RichFace Mobile Skin1" src="/images/jroller/rf.phone.day3.page1.JPG"/></a><br /> 
                </p><br /> 
                <p><br /> 
                As you can see with the <a href="/images/jroller/rf.phone.day3.page2.JPG">second page</a> (below), this is not a standard accordion panel type of component. When you touch an option from page one, the accordion expands on a different page and only focuses on that specific panel. Not sure if it could work, but accordion collapse/expand style of components don&#8216;t make a ton of sense to me on limited screen real estate.<br /> 
                <a href="/images/jroller/rf.phone.day3.page2.JPG"><img style="margin:0 7px 0 0;" alt="RichFace Mobile Skin1" src="/images/jroller/rf.phone.day3.page2.JPG"/></a><br /> 
                </p><br /> 
                <p><br /> 
                So after you go through the menu options and decide on a component, you are taken to the <a href="/images/jroller/rf.phone.day3.page3.JPG">detail/demo screen</a>(below) where you can play around with your component of choice.</p> 
                
                <p>Note the small orange page marker dots at the bottom. The user would have the ability to flip through each component in the given section by swiping horizontally.<br /> 
                <a href="/images/jroller/rf.phone.day3.page3.JPG"><img style="margin:0 7px 0 0;" alt="RichFace Mobile Skin1" src="/images/jroller/rf.phone.day3.page3.JPG"/></a><br /> 
                <br/><br/><br/><br />

                <p><p>Day 2 of the RichFaces skinning and we have the first approach for tablet devices. Tablets are a little harder to design for because of a few reasons:</p> 
                
                <p>1) Your design sits on the fine line between desktop and mobile. You are designing your app for a max 1024 pixel resolution (in landscape mode) but you must also take advantage of mobile usability (which you will see in page2)</p> 
                
                <p>2) Similar to the iPad Mail.app, it&#8216;s almost like you are designing 2 different UI&#8216;s for landscape and portrait modes. For portrait you need more drop down menus, and for landscape you can try to fit everything on one page without the drop downs.</p><br /> 
                <p><a href="/images/jroller/rf.tablet.day2.page1.jpg"><img alt="RichFace Mobile Skin1" align="right" width="225px" src="/images/jroller/rf.tablet.day2.page1-small.JPG"/></a><br /> 
                <p class="pTitle">Day 2: About The Design</p><br /> 
                Here we have the interaction broken out into 2 pages. The first page shows the primary menu and isn&#8216;t all that exciting.</p> 
                
                <p>Notice how, unlike the <a href="http://www.wesleyhales.com/entry/going_mobile_with_richfaces_we">iphone design from Day 1</a>, I left the browser button overrides within the app itself. Tablet web apps are completely use case driven so this will vary. But since we have so much more real estate, we can play around with standard navigation options that keep the user's attention focused on the app itself.</p><br /> 
                <p><br /> 
                <a href="/images/jroller/rf.tablet.day2.page2.jpg"><img style="margin:0 7px 0 0;" alt="RichFace Mobile Skin1" align="left" width="225px" src="/images/jroller/rf.tablet.day2.page2-small.JPG"/></a></p> 
                
                <p><br/><br/><br/><br /> 
                The second page is what you see after selecting a menu item from page 1 (click to enlarge). Here we have the title bar at the top left with a built in back button which takes the user back to the first screen.</p> 
                
                <p>To the right of the title you see the secondary menu represented by rounded rectangles. Next is the main content of the page broken out into content and actionable panels.</p>
                
                <p>And finally you have the big arrows to the right and left. These arrows are &#8220;thumb reachable&#8221; which is a common usability pattern in portrait mode tablets. It provides an easy page flip access to all of the RichFaces components within the top level category.<br /> 
                </p><br /> 
                <p>The great thing about CSS3 transitions is that you can really make a UI like this scream and flow seamlessly. So you can imagine how tapping an arrow with your thumb will slide in a new component demo and gracefully highlight the secondary menu option at the top.</p><br /> 
                <p>So this concludes our design for Day 2. As I said earlier, this is more of a use case driven design. WE could spawn a very minimalistic skin and component look and feel from this. However, It would be more to display the power behind RichFaces ajax and templating features as the user moves through the app.</p></p>

                <p><p>Today marks an important day in the <a href="http://www.jboss.org/richfaces">RichFaces project</a> as we continue to head down the mobile web road. Since we have such a great community of users and followers, we want you to be involved with the design process.<br /> 
                So each day this week, I will come up with a new proposed design/theme for RichFaces Mobile and we want to hear your feedback. </p><p>I will announce each new design (both for tablet and phone) via <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/richfaces">twitter</a> with a link back to this article. I will try my best to pick apart each design and describe why I did what I did, and hope you can give me some real world feedback. We want this project to actually make sense and be usable to what you guys are facing in the real world. Without further adieu....</p><br /> 
                <p><a href="/images/jroller/rf-mobile-skin1.JPG"><img alt="RichFace Mobile Skin1" align="right" width="200px" src="/images/jroller/rf-mobile-skin1-small.jpg"/></a>Our first task is to tackle the RichFaces showcase of components. Classifying what is mobile ready and which components may need a little work.<br /> 
                <p class="pTitle">Day 1: About The Design</p><br /> 
                Here we have what could be the RichFaces component showcase skin. This is what I will be posting a new version of each day this week.</p> 
                
                <p>In this design we have the standard browser “functionality take over” at the top header. The custom back button is essential to mobile web design and must be overridden here &#8211; following the pattern of previous designs.</p> 
                
                <p>Nothing too different about the standard menu options and detail options (center stage). Following convention here as well. One thing I am adhering too are the usability guidelines set forth by Jakob Nielsen&#8216;s <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/reports/mobile/ipad/">Usability of iPad Apps and Websites</a></p> 
                
                <p>To get the full tab bar at the bottom (and to replicate the native feel) the user must bookmark the application. I think it makes sense for this menu to be contextual to the app and provide other alternate routes.<br />

                <p><p>Working with portlet technology is often discredited for it’s seemingly complex <span class="caps">API</span> and development hoops one must jump through. But if you have worked on a portlet project for a considerable amount of time, and then jump back to a servlet based project, you have a feeling that life just got easier.<br /> 
                This is all within the context of which servlet-based framework you might be working with, but overall things are a bit easier when dealing with one request and response.</p></p>
                
                
                <p></p>
                
                <p><p>What if you didn’t have to worry about portlet development gotchas anymore? What if you could develop portlets with the ease and hassle free life that you have with good ol’ servlets? Well, I’m here to tell you that this can be partly achieved with JSR-301 portlet bridge technology.</p></p>
                
                
                <p></p>
                
                <p><p>I encourage (actually I dare you) to those who have never even touched a portal to take the JBoss Portlet Bridge for a test drive. It takes <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/jboss/GateIn/Portal/3.1.0-FINAL/GateIn-3.1.0-FINAL-jbossas.zip">1 download (GateIn bundled with JBoss)</a> and one maven archetype to get started. You can choose from any combination of plain <span class="caps">JSF</span>, Richfaces, and Seam with<br /> 
                <code style="color:white">mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeCatalog=http://bit.ly/jbossportletbridge</code> from the command line.<br />

                “A portlet bridge allows you to run application frameworks like <span class="caps">JSF</span> in a portal environment without needing to know anything about the underlying portlet <span class="caps">API</span> or portlet concepts.”<br />

                And if all that wasn’t enough, I will be giving a 50 minute talk at JBoss World titled <a href="http://www.redhat.com/summit/sessions/jboss.html">"Making Portals Cool: The Compelling Advantages of a Portlet Bridge"</a> where you can come and personally track me down and specifically tell me about your problems, pains, or happiness with the project or the world in general <img src="http://www.jroller.com/images/smileys/wink.gif" class="smiley" alt=";)" title=";)" /> JBoss World will be located in Boston from May 3&#8211;6.<br />

                <p><p>I've always heard good things about Jazoon and I got to experience it first hand this week. Definitely one of the larger conferences based in Europe, I was impressed not only by the venue but also with the star studded line&#45;up of talented speakers/developers.</p></p>
                
                
                <p></p>
                
                <p><p>I was pleasantly surprised to see soo many talks about portal technologies. And people weren't talking about the spec or the technology itself, but about specific usecases &#45; which is really cool. However, Andy Bosch did an excellent job of explaining the JSR&#45;301/329 portlet bridge. <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/wesleyhales/if-you-know-jsf-you-know-portals-and-portlets">My talk</a> was more vendor specific on the <a href="http://jboss.org/portletbridge/">JBoss Portlet Bridge</a> and the features that we offer with Seam and RichFaces, so it was great to have someone there to explain the spec in detail and give a non&#45;vendor specific view.</p></p>
                
                
                <p></p>
                
                <p><p>Andrew Lombardi announced his love for JSF and that the Wicket folks may/will begin to focus on a better component library community. I hate to mention JSF within the same paragraph as Wicket <img src="http://www.jroller.com/images/smileys/wink.gif" class="smiley" alt=";)" title=";)" /> but when a developer at XYZ corporation wants to implement some usecase that makes use of a lot of different components, 99% of the time they will look to JSF and its many component libraries/communities. Not to get into a holy war here, because of course Wicket has a different way of handling it's components &#45; and an overall different (better) way of handling the model and binding of components. The one thing that is missing from Wicket (in my mind) is heavy focus on polished component libraries and communities.</p></p>
                
                
                <p></p>
                
                <p><p>Matthew McCullough put on a great show with his Maven 3 presentation. The use of screenflow and his rate of speech were right on the money. It has inspired me to try just a little bit harder with my talks.</p></p>
                
                
                <p></p>
                
                <p><p>The Arquillian talk by Dan Allen and Aslak Knutsen ended as a great talk and shirt throwing fun. Of course, a few of the audience members had to pay the price of Dan's throwing arm &#45; aim at the back row, but hit someone in the middle row with alot of force :D In all seriousness, Arquillian is taking the testing world by storm so you better jump on the train or get out of the way.</p></p>
                
                
                <p></p>
                
                <p><p>There were many other great talks given by other speakers. So, it was definitely a good knowledge sharing event.<br /> 
                Overall, I had a great time and met a lot of people whom I have only talked to through twitter and email. For me, it is soo much easier to blast or praise someone online when you have sat down and had a beer with them &#45; but that&#8216;s just me.</p></p>

                <p>Before I begin, let me say thank you! thank you! thank you! for the extended EL in Seam. On a previous project, I was using straight JSF 1.1/1.2(Myfaces) and the extended EL alone, makes Seam a worthwhile choice.</p>

                <p>This article is about an application that is relatively simple (to start). A report with customer information that has pretty charts and graphs and is printable to PDF. Since I didn't have any requirements to start, I thought I would list a few of my own here ;)</p>

                <h2>JSF &amp; Seam </h2>
                
                
                <p></p>
                
                <p>When I started development, Seam was at v.1.2, Embedded EJB (aka Embedded Jboss) was at RC9, and Jetty was being used for local dev and testing. I was able to get a jump start from the guys over at <a href="http://software.softeu.cz/archetypes/seam/">http://softeu.cz</a> for the jetty/ejb/war deployment and I found a rouge project on the seam boards called JBossSeamDVDStore that gave me the ejb Maven archetype ideas/best practice. </p>
                
                
                <p></p>
                
                <p>I went through some good (and bad) code getting the embedded RC9 stuff working with Jetty. It boiled down to <a href="http://www.jboss.com/index.html?module=bb&op=viewtopic&t=110555">this post</a> showing why and what I did.</p>
                
                
                <p></p>
                
                <p>The good and bad news now is that Embedded EJB3 is now Embedded Jboss and Embedded Jboss only works with Tomcat (for now) and here is <a href="http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=WhatRefactoringsWereDoneToEnableEmbeddedJBoss">a post explaining</a> why it's this way. But this could also be a blueprint for creating the same thing for Jetty, I just don't have the time to do it right now.</p>
                
                
                <p></p>
                
                <p><a href="http://www.google.com/notebook/public/09243180899526162200/BDRKQSgoQ77rF_7Yi">Here is a list</a> of resources I found useful while researching.<p> 
                
                <h2>RESTful URL's</h2> 
                <p>The #1 biggest complaint using JSF is no RESTful urls, and Seam does a great job of solving it. The only problem I have now is double execution when the user does a postback to a page that has a action mapped in pages.xml. The form I'm submitting calls the same action as the url I have mapped for REST support. I haven't spent alot of time with it and it may be total user error, but it would be nice if double action execution did NOT happen naturally.</p> 
                
                <h2>EJB3/Hibernate</h2> 
                <p>Using seam-gen, in Oracle, a few tables had null id fields and no primary key - The generated entity bean was genned as a object with one member (an ID) and I guess it was considering the entire record (all columns) as a unique. Being new to EntityBean/Generated hibernate code, it took us a few hours to figure this out, but once we saw that the data model was screwed up and how seam-gen handled it, the fix was easy.</p> 
                
                <h2>Local, rapid, development</h2> 
                <p>This was mentioned a little in the first paragraph. I wanted a faster, local build environment than what was currently offered by the company I'm working for. They are heavily tied to ant and there were 0 projects using Maven. So, being the completely crazy person that I am, I introduced a new build method with Maven 2, a new Framework wrapper (Seam), and a local build on the developers laptop with hot deploy. I know Jboss AS offers hot deploy, but I really wanted to use Jetty with Embedded Jboss. Since, that isn't currently implemented, I went with the next best thing and used Tomcat. My current company gives every developer a Solaris box to build on, all builds/projects are tied to building on Solaris. When one tries to use IntelliJ Idea over a Samba mount, you will quickly see how much it brings down overall performance and speed. There are other pluses that I could go into on local dev opposed to a remote *nix box, but I will stop here.</p> 
                
                <h2>Maven 2</h2> 
                <p>When you have 100's of projects on Ant and everyone in the company is pro Ant because so much time has been invested into the current build environment, you really feel like your going against the grain. However, most of us in the open source world, that are consultants, have seen the light on other projects and we bring new things into whoever we are working for. This is what I did. I eventually gained a few supporters, because everyone knows what happens when you are close minded to innovation.</p> 
                
                <h2>Charts</h2> 
                <p>I think using the Trinidad Charts are what WOW'd the upper management the most. Since this company has a distributed computing environment with no admin rights, we had to get the security/network folks on board with the Adobe SVG plugin. I heard the Renesis viewer is pretty good also and we will probably move to it later since Adobe is killing support on their plugin.</p> 
                
                <h2>Html 2 PDF functionality</h2> 
                <p> 
                PD4ML: I started with this HTML2PDF renderer. It was super easy to get hooked up to the app. I structured my xhtml and css for both screen and print media types, but due to lack of CSS 2.1 support and very limited subset of css and html support, the output was terrible and required alot of rework just for this PDF to render half way decent. And it costs money :( 
                </p> 
                <p> With the output coming out horrible in PD4ML, I took a look at <a href="https://xhtmlrenderer.dev.java.net/r7/feature-list.html">a pure xhtml renderer, Flying Saucer. </a></p> 
                <p>FS Almost instantly rendered all of my XHTML correctly on the first render. I had to make a few adjustments for things like CSS page-break properties and border-collapse. And, before I could even get the page to render I had to clean up the legacy HTML that some <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TRINIDAD-111">JSF renderers output</a> (I ran tests with both Jtidy and NekoHTML) - both did the trick and I couldn't tell a difference. All the JSF folks that I have talked to welcome feature requests for XHTML compliance. 
                </p> 
                <p> 
                <a href="http://www.pdoubleya.com/projects/flyingsaucer/demo/r7/browser/browser_demo.jnlp">This demo</a> shows some pretty cool stuff from Flying Saucer and what it can do. It is basically the same concept of iTunes web browser/desktop app. PDF isn't the end of the road either - they have examples on rendering the exact same XHTML content to PNG, SVG, and Excel - I'm sure there will be more. 
                </p> 
                <p>There are probably a million more things in Seam that I could talk about here, that I completely can't live without. This article just touches on the real world stuff that I encountered while developing. </p>
