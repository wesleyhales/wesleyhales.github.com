        I started writing code on an Apple IIe when I was 9. We used to get magazines that had coding examples in the back written in Basic and I would sit for hours copying line-by-line, each GOTO and IF/THEN conditional. That was my first open source experience.
        Over the last decade
        <a href='http://github.com/wesleyhales/'>I've worked with a few languages.</a>
        Mostly Java, Ruby, and other related server-side frameworks, along with scripting in perl, php, and anything else required to accomplish the task at hand... I've seen a lot of shit come and go.
        As a UI developer, I consider JavaScript, CSS, and HTML as my strengths.

        My designs usually start out with a rough draft on a sheet of paper. From there, I use the pen tool to redraw in Photoshop. Design work is a creative outlet for me and I try to design something at least every few months.

        In March of 2012 I built (one of?) the first real time feedback system for audiences. It's called
        <a href='https://www.onslyde.com'>Onslyde</a>
        and is a WebSocket (with fallbacks) driven feedback system to be used in conferences, classrooms, and any other
        place where people collect and their opinions are valued.

        InstaOps was a mobile analytics side project I worked on with 2 other founders.
        <a href='http://blog.apigee.com/apigee_acquires_instaops_embracing_the_apps_everywhere_world'>
          It was acquired in mid-2012 by Apigee.
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some of the early prototypes I mocked up in Photoshop and later implemented in (uggh JSF), HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
        I had a long history with JSF (Java Server Faces), so it was easy to stand up a complex dashboard quickly. It's all about what
        you know, right?

      <p>
        After the acquisition, I had a very ambitious goal of carrying this product through a complete rewrite and merging
        it with Apigee's existing portfolio of OSS products. If you're really interested,

        Cormada is a project I thought of back in 2010.
        <a href='http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/29/yc-funded-bushido-an-app-store-for-the-web-that-can-kickstart-your-side-projects/'>Bushido</a>
        came along shortly after I stalled on the idea. The basic idea was: upload any POC or example project you have written and let others run or use it. If it's good, turn it into an OSS project. No idea if it could make money :)

      <p>Here we have a fully implemented Firefox theme circa 2009. Over 1.2 million installs and 300k active daily users. During the Firefox 3.6 era, this theme was hot and I received quite a few generous donations from random, kind-hearted people. A very worth while open source effort for me.</p>

      </div>
      <p>
        This next theme just ended up being a creative experiment. I never made it to publishing the actual theme on Mozilla's website. After Firefox 4 came along, things began moving so freakin' fast in the browser scene and I couldn't keep up with porting my themes to the new versions.
