      <description>For those interested: Usergrid, a Backend as a Service, was acquired by Apigee in early 2012 and has served as the core tool of all Apigee trainings and developer outreach efforts. Developers use it to create a backend for their mobile apps amongst many other things like managing users, roles and permissions. The Mobile Analytics product is something I was partial to since I created the original UI - before it was acquired by Apigee.</description>
