      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got one of those &#34;tech support&#34; phone calls from a family member this weekend, asking if I could help him undelete some files that were deleted by some ghost that snuck into his office ;) You gotta love it when people say they have no idea how an entire folder got deleted and they swear they&#39;ve been hacked.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So I scoured the web to see what exists. For *nix based utils, I think &lt;A href=&#34;http://www.sleuthkit.org/&#34;&gt;sleuthkit&lt;/a&gt; with the autopsy forensics browser is the best out there (that&#39;s open source).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But of course this user was on a Windows box. I finally found a really nice free tool for recovering files from NTFS. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ntfsundelete.com/&#34;&gt;NTFSUndelete&lt;/a&gt; does exactly what the titles says. Saved the day for me and the person who &#34;got hacked&#34; ;) &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;One other really cool forensics tool I ran across was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.e-fense.com/products.php&#34;&gt;Helix&lt;/a&gt; from a company called e-fence. This is really powerful stuff and the guys from hak5 actually did a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hak5.org/episodes/episode-413&#34;&gt;segment&lt;/a&gt; on how to use the tool in one of their episodes.&lt;/p&gt;
