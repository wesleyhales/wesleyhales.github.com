      <description>Today marks my 1 year anniversary of blogging. I started this blog to basically express my views and opinions, to give back to the open source community of whom so much has been taken, and for job credibility.
Trying to write good articles is a lot of work. Sure anybody can write about a few buzzwords and get some hits, but an article with substance and that actually helps someone through a use case or problem is where the satisfaction comes from.</description>
