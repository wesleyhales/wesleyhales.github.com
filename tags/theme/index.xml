      <description>This weekend was quite an eye opener for me. Since the first public release of ANTHEM (my Firefox 3 theme), I have been trying to think of a way to monetize the downloads. Not really looking for a way to get rich, but a way to take advantage of, as of today, a theme that has been downloaded almost 500,000 times.
I started out with a Paypal donate button which helped a little, but wasn&#39;t really doing what I wanted.</description>

      <description>**UPDATE - This theme is now available on Mozilla.org here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/9627/  I decided to tryout Firefox theme building a few weeks ago on vacation. It took me a few days to design the skin and slice up all the images for theme creation. But once it came to laying down the Firefox CSS, I have to say that I was a little overwhelmed and haven&amp;rsquo;t been back to finish the theme since.</description>
