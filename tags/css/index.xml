      <description>Debugging jank, reflows, etc&amp;hellip; The Skia debugger was mentioned a few weeks ago at EdgeConf as a way to examine how the DOM is loaded and processed in the Chromium web browser. Skia is the open source C++ graphics library backing Chromium/Chrome. It comes with a graphical tool used to step through and analyze the contents of the skia picture format.
If you havenâ€™t watched this video, I recommend you take a few minutes and watch the first part to understand the context of why the Skia debugger was mentioned and where it might be useful.</description>

      <description>There are several possible ways to go about building a CSS framework. The framework I mention here is suited for myself and the group of developers I work with. It has proven successful on the past 3 projects I have been on. Once everyone knows about a base set of styles it&#39;s amazing how much more productive the team is. Not only do you have a &#34;master&#34; type of stylesheet to work from, everyone can edit the code and make changes faster because they are aware of the framework in use.</description>
