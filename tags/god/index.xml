      <description>I recently created a Firefox 3 theme out of curiosity and because I love to try new things that deal with design. Much to my surprise, ANTHEM has been receiving a lot of attention over the past week since it has been released publicly on Mozilla.org. ANTHEM is named so because I consider it a hymn of praise or loyalty to my worshipful savior Jesus Christ. I also consider it dedicated to my newborn son, my wonderful wife, and the woman who raised me to be the man I am, my beautiful mother.</description>
