      <description>I&#39;ve always heard good things about Jazoon and I got to experience it first hand this week. Definitely one of the larger conferences based in Europe, I was impressed not only by the venue but also with the star studded line&amp;#45;up of talented speakers/developers.
I was pleasantly surprised to see soo many talks about portal technologies. And people weren&#39;t talking about the spec or the technology itself, but about specific usecases &amp;#45; which is really cool.</description>
