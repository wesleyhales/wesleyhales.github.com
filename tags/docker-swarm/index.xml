      <description>In Part 1, I reviewed the gory details of the foundation required to run synthetic browser testing at scale. Now that we have a framework for building out our tests, we can move forward with wrapping our test runner in a web application so that the metrics we care about can be gathered and viewed through a decent UI.
For this example, I&amp;rsquo;m going to use the Alexa top 12 news sites and execute a test over each one with the latest Chrome web browser.</description>

      <description>Docker Swarm and Selenium Both Docker and Selenium are pretty much household names these days in the world of software engineering. I&amp;rsquo;ve been fascinated with Docker since its inception and have been using it for side projects and in my day job for a few years now. I recently came across the need to test a Chrome extension and load a web page while that extension is installed. This test would load the page, wait for it to load, check some JS variables and APIs and then spit out a screenshot and any needed metrics.</description>
