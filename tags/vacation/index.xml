      <description>I guess everybody has a place a few hours from home that they can go and relax and enjoy nature. One rednecktastic place I like to go is at the foothills of the Smoky Mountains in Tennessee. Gatlinburg is a trip, and if you like Dolly Parton, well this is the place for you.

I mainly enjoy the fresh mountain air, the beautiful scenery, and the below freezing temps at night.</description>
