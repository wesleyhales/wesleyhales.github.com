      <description>Overview Watching frame rates on CSS and/or JavaScript animation is pretty addictive. I wrote this article the other day which examines the performance of a simple countdown timer within the Angular lifecycle. I then spent countless minutes playing Jake Archibald&amp;rsquo;s Jank Invaders to hone my skills and save the universe from jank :)

      <description>Overview Some of the best known approaches for running a countdown or count-up timer in AngularJS are shown on JSFiddle using setInterval and Angular&amp;rsquo;s builtin $timeout.
 Both approaches require the use of $scope.$apply, which is completely normal. It forces the page/bindings to update when a change is made outside of the AngularJS lifecycle (like inside a setInterval or setTimeout). If you want to read more about $scope.$apply check out this article.</description>
