      <description>Overview At the beginning of 2013 I was given the incredible opportunity to start with an empty canvas and come up with a completely new web application for Apigee. For the past year I&amp;rsquo;ve been heads down on merging Apigee&amp;rsquo;s Usergrid and Mobile Analytics products using AngularJS.
For those interested: Usergrid, a Backend as a Service, was acquired by Apigee in early 2012 and has served as the core tool of all Apigee trainings and developer outreach efforts.</description>

      <description>Overview Some of the best known approaches for running a countdown or count-up timer in AngularJS are shown on JSFiddle using setInterval and Angular&amp;rsquo;s builtin $timeout.
 Both approaches require the use of $scope.$apply, which is completely normal. It forces the page/bindings to update when a change is made outside of the AngularJS lifecycle (like inside a setInterval or setTimeout). If you want to read more about $scope.$apply check out this article.</description>
