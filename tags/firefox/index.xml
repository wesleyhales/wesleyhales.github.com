      <description>I started laying down ideas for a new Firefox theme a few months ago and this is what emerged. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why I can&amp;rsquo;t stay away from the darker themes. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s the richness that black (and darker colors) allows on a monitor, but I tried to stay as far away from mainstream design on this as I could. I have already coded this into a downloadable theme, but I am still working out some glitches.</description>

      <description>This weekend was quite an eye opener for me. Since the first public release of ANTHEM (my Firefox 3 theme), I have been trying to think of a way to monetize the downloads. Not really looking for a way to get rich, but a way to take advantage of, as of today, a theme that has been downloaded almost 500,000 times.
I started out with a Paypal donate button which helped a little, but wasn&#39;t really doing what I wanted.</description>

      <description>I recently created a Firefox 3 theme out of curiosity and because I love to try new things that deal with design. Much to my surprise, ANTHEM has been receiving a lot of attention over the past week since it has been released publicly on Mozilla.org. ANTHEM is named so because I consider it a hymn of praise or loyalty to my worshipful savior Jesus Christ. I also consider it dedicated to my newborn son, my wonderful wife, and the woman who raised me to be the man I am, my beautiful mother.</description>

      <description>**UPDATE - This theme is now available on Mozilla.org here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/9627/  I decided to tryout Firefox theme building a few weeks ago on vacation. It took me a few days to design the skin and slice up all the images for theme creation. But once it came to laying down the Firefox CSS, I have to say that I was a little overwhelmed and haven&amp;rsquo;t been back to finish the theme since.</description>
