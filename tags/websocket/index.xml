      <description>Disclaimer: Minimal load testing was performed with 10000 concurrent WebSocket connections. You can see some true performance numbers here.      
Here is the demo in action. As you can see on the right, I have 2 chat windows open and on the left we have a member registration. Users are chatting across a raw WebSocket connection and when another user registers, the CDI event is fired all the way through to the browser as a JavaScript alert via the connected WebSocket clients.</description>
