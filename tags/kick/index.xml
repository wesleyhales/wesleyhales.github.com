      <description>The designer inside me just won&#39;t give up. I have tried and tried to put down the Photoshop paint brush and embrace development only, but it just isn&#39;t going to happen. I care just as much about semantic HTML and css/designer stuff as I do about hard core Java development. Some say it&#39;s easy to be a jack of all trades and a master of none. But I am naturally forced to slap that theory in the face and then kick it in the balls ;-)</description>
