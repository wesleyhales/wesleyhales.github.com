      <description>The following post is a long-winded summary of my experiences over the past year. I started a user group, wrote a book, gave up a secure job, and changed jobs 4 times.

      <description>Not too bad for a 2 month time span, but what really matters is getting comments that ask questions or suggestions that add to the article&amp;rsquo;s value.</description>
