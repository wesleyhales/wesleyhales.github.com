      <description>I got one of those &#34;tech support&#34; phone calls from a family member this weekend, asking if I could help him undelete some files that were deleted by some ghost that snuck into his office ;) You gotta love it when people say they have no idea how an entire folder got deleted and they swear they&#39;ve been hacked.
So I scoured the web to see what exists. For *nix based utils, I think sleuthkit with the autopsy forensics browser is the best out there (that&#39;s open source).</description>
