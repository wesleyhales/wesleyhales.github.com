      <description>I dedicated some time this weekend to creating a fully functional demo with OpenSocial, Shindig and JBoss Portal. It seems like OpenSocial has a lot of new supported platforms coming out in 0.8 and the future is looking promising. Here is a bullet list to summarize what I found:
 Documentation is scarce when you want to roll you own OS container via Shindig Luckily Chris Schalk did a good job providing some documentation on getting persistence setup on a mysql db Unfortunately, due to the bleeding edge of this technology, some of (the few) demos that exist don&amp;rsquo;t work with today&amp;rsquo;s Shindig trunk I was able to quickly learn Google widgeting and am on my way to being a &amp;ldquo;widget master&amp;rdquo; Next on the list is to mess around with Google Data APIs in OpenSocial Apps The transition/integration of Shindig into a standard webapp/portlet was a huge pita.</description>
